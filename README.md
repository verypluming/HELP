# HELP: A Dataset for Handling Entailments with Lexical and Logical Phenomena (Ver.1.0)

## Overview
The HELP dataset is an automatically created natural language inference (NLI) dataset that embodies the combination of lexical and logical inferences focusing on monotonicity (i.e., phrase replacement-based reasoning).
The HELP (Ver.1.0) has 36K inference pairs consisting of upward monotone, downward monotone, non-monotone, conjunction, and disjunction.

## HELP dataset
```bash
output_en/
pmb_train_v1.0.tsv
```

## Replicating the HELP
If you would like to replicate the HELP dataset, try the following procedure:
### Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/verypluming/HELP.git
cd HELP
pyenv virtualenv 3.4.6 help
pyenv activate help
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('wordnet')"
```

### Installing [C&C parser](https://github.com/chrzyki/candc) and [Parallel Meaning Bank (PMB)](http://pmb.let.rug.nl/)
Please download C&C, set it up, and create a file `data/parser_location.txt` with the path to the C&C parser.
Then, please download PMB version 2.1.0 [here](https://pmb.let.rug.nl/data.php) and put it to `data/` directry.

```bash
echo "candc:/path/to/candc-1.00/" > data/parser_location.txt
```

### Data creation

```bash
python scripts/create_dataset_PMB.py
```
